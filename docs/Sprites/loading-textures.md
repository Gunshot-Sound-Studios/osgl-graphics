# Loading Textures

To load file formats such as `PNGs`, `WebPs`, etc., OSGL uses its own external tool. The tool is bundled with OSGL on the github releases page, [here](https://github.com/Gunshot-Sound-Studios/osgl-graphics/releases/latest), named `image-converter` (previously `converter`). Pick the one for your OS. If you don't know which to pick, feel free to ask us!

:::note
You can get help with the `image-converter` exe by running it in the command-prompt, with the `-h` flag! e.g:

```bash
> image-converter -h
```

:::
The `image-converter` turns these image formats into OSGLs custom image-format, which you can learn more about [here](./custom-texture-format).

We can load textures into OSGL with the `texture.from` function, which takes the texture generated by the `image-converter`:

```lua
local OSGL = require(path.to.osgl)
local texture = OSGL.texture
​
local txt = texture.from(script.ModuleThatReturnsTexture)
-- "txt" now contains OSGL-Texture data
```

You can also create a blank texture of the given width, and height, with the `texture.new` function:

```lua
local OSGL = require(path.to.osgl)
local texture = OSGL.texture
​
local txt = texture.new(50, 50) -- Creates a 50x50 texture
```

:::info
Remember, like `Window`s, `Texture`s can also be drawn to! You can edit a texture like any other window by passing it as the first argument of a `draw` function.
