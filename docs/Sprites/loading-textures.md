# Loading Textures

To load file formats such as `PNGs`, and `WebPs`, OSGL uses its own external tool. The tool bundles with OSGL on the github releases, [here](https://github.com/Gunshot-Sound-Studios/osgl-graphics/releases/latest), named `converter.exe`!

:::note
You can get help with the `converter` exe by running it in the command-prompt, with the `-h` flag! e.g:
```bash
> converter -h
```
:::
The converter turns these image formats into OSGLs custom image-format, which you can learn more about [here](./custom-texture-format).

We can load textures into OSGL with the `texture.from` function, which takes the texture generated by the `converter`, or a module that returns that:

```lua
local OSGL = require(path.to.osgl)
local texture = OSGL.texture
​
local txt = texture.from(script.ModuleThatReturnsTexture)
-- "txt" now contains OSGL-Texture data
```

You can also create a blank texture of the given width, and height, with the `texture.new` function:
```lua
local OSGL = require(path.to.osgl)
local texture = OSGL.texture
​
local txt = texture.new(50, 50) -- Creates a 50x50 texture
```

:::info
Remember that like windows, textures can also be drawn to! You can edit a texture like any other window by passing it as the first argument of a `draw` function.
