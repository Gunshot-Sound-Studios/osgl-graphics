# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for OSGL (*Open-Source Graphical Library*)! OSGL is an open-source framework designed to provide developers with an efficient way to manipulate and render pixel data using EditableImages.

*Please note that OSGL is currently in a "beta" phase. While many features are planned, they are yet to be implemented. Your feedback and contributions are invaluable as we continue to enhance the library!* 

# What This Documentation Covers
In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Open a window using **OSGL**.
- Draw **pixels**, **shapes**, and other graphical elements such as sprites to the window.

*This documentation assumes you have a basic understand of [**Luau**](https://luau.org). If you're new, you can find plenty of resources online!*
