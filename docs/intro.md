# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for OSGL (*Open-Source Graphical Library*)! OSGL is an open-source framework designed to provide developers with an efficient way to manipulate and render pixel data using EditableImages.

*Please note that OSGL is currently in a "beta" phase. While various features are planned, they are yet to be fully implemented. Your feedback and contributions are essential as we refine and enhance the library.*

## What This Documentation Covers

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Open a window using **OSGL**.
- Draw **pixels**, **shapes**, and other graphical elements such as textures to the window.

*This documentation assumes a basic understanding of [`Luau`](https://luau.org). For those new to the language, numerous resources are available for learning.*
