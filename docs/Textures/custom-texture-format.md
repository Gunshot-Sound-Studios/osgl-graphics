# Custom OSGL Image Format

:::info
This format is used internally by OSGL and is not related to rendering images on the screen. If you're interested in the file structure, please continue reading.
:::

An OSGL texture is generated by `image-converter`. The texture, represented as a dictionary, contains three keys:

- `width`: The width of the texture as a `number`.
- `height`: The height of the texture as a `number`.
- `pixels`: The raw pixel data of the texture as a `buffer`.

## Colors

Colors are stored as 32-bit unsigned integers (`u32`). This allows for compact representation and fast manipulation of colors as single numbers.

Each 32-bit color value consists of four 8-bit components: Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (opacity). These components are packed into the 32-bit integer, with each component occupying one byte (8 bits).

## Byte Layout of the Color

The four components are stored in the following order, from the most significant byte to the least significant byte:

- **First byte** (bits 1-8): Red (R)
- **Second byte** (bits 9-16): Green (G)
- **Third byte** (bits 17-24): Blue (B)
- **Fourth byte** (bits 25-32): Alpha (A)

This can be visualized as:

|    R    |    G    |    B    |    A    |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  8 bits |  8 bits |  8 bits |  8 bits |
|   1-8   |  9-16   |  17-24  |  25-32  |

For example, consider a color with the following components:

- Red (**R**): 255 (`0xFF`)
- Green (**G**): 128 (`0x80`)
- Blue (**B**): 64 (`0x40`)
- Alpha (**A**): 255 (`0xFF`)

These components would be packed into a 32-bit integer as follows:

- Red (**R**): 255 (`0xFF`) -> Occupies bits 24-31
- Green (**G**): 128 (`0x80`) -> Occupies bits 16-23
- Blue (**B**): 64 (`0x40`) -> Occupies bits 8-15
- Alpha (**A**): 255 (`0xFF`) -> Occupies bits 0-7

The resulting 32-bit integer representation would be: `0xFF8040FF` (`4286595327`).
