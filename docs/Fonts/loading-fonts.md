# Loading Fonts

To load fonts such as `ttf`, etc., OSGL uses its own external tool. The tool is bundled with OSGL on the github releases page, [here](https://github.com/osgl-rbx/osgl/releases/latest). Pick the one for your OS. If you don't know which to pick, feel free to ask us!

:::note
You can get help with the exe by running it in the command-prompt, with the `-h` flag! e.g:

```bash
> font-converter -h
```

:::
You can load fonts into OSGL with the `Font.from` function, which takes the font generated by the `font-converter`:

```lua
local OSGL = require(path.to.osgl)
local Font = OSGL.Font
â€‹
local fnt = Font.from(script.ModuleThatReturnsFont)
-- "fnt" now contains the loaded font
```
